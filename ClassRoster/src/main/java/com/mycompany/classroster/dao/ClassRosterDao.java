 * This interface defines the methods that must be implemented by any class that

 * file-based DAO in the code-along. You could imagine, however, an 
 * implementation that only stored student data in memory or one that stored 
 * student data in a database. Each class would be different but all would 
 * implement that same interface, ensuring that they are all well encapsulated. 
 * Note that the ClassRosterController only uses this interface to reference 
 * the DAO â€” it is completely unaware of the implementation details.
